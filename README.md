# Bradesco_Validator
This project is a Bradesco bank branch checker system, in which the user enters the branch number and, according to the bank's own calculation, it informs the validating digit for that account. (Remember that this project is just for studies, without any monetary or official intentions from Bradesco bank. Thank you and I hope you enjoy it!!)
